## What is TTC website ?

TTC short for The Terminal Cafe is a welcoming discord server for everything related to technology with other fun things sprinkled on top of it. We started on 2019 as CTT and quickly became a melting-pot for tech minded from people all around the world later we rebranded our self as The Terminal Cafe. The website is just another attempt from us to make technology more accessible to everyone anywhere around the world .

### How pages are generated ??

All files and folders are presented as a tree in the project. We have created some predefined templates which gets used while generating the webpages. First the user uploads the folder containing a markdown file with the content , a thumbnail icon and an article banner. If it gets accepted after our internal review we pull that folder in our main source and that page becomes a part of our website.

## Adding articles to the repository 

You can add articles to the website just like how we add code to the project but in-case of articles you need to add bit more things and you have to follow the predefined format. (_read Formatting_)

Our website is divided in  4 categories 
1. News articles
2. Coding Tutorials
3. Non tech stuff 
4. Admin pages

We use tags and paths to determine how the page will be placed.If you want to add an article after creating your own fork, create a folder in the category you want to create an article for with the naming conversion `[yourpostwithourspaces]` , inside that folder create a markdown file which will hold the main content and metadata for that particular article. While creating the file follow the naming conversion

Congratulations you have created the blank article now you will have to add 2 images for the same. One a thumbnail and two a banner , add both of them in the same folder as the markdown file. These file should also follow the standard naming convention 
##### Naming Convention
1. Folder name --> `[yourpostwithourspaces-yyyymmdd]`.
2. Markdown file --> `[yourpostwithourspaces-yyyymmdd.md]`.
3. Icon --> `[yourpostwithourspaces-icn-yyyymmdd.md]`.
4. Banner --> `[yourpostwithourspaces-banner-yyyymmdd.md]`.

After you are done now write your article and verify for any mistakes. When you are done create a PR we will verify the request and if its ok we will add that to our repo. Please contact the admin team for more info or any questions.

Example file structure 
```
root
	|__content
	| |__news
	|	|__ pos-20221101
	|		|__ pos-20221101.md
	|		|__ pos-icn-20221101.md
	|		|__ pos-banner-20221101.md
